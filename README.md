These files read Biosemi data in BDF format. There are 3 optons:

1) extract_data_biosemi: this file is written in Matlab

2) extract_data_biosemi_mex: this file is written in Matlab and uses the mex function Read_BDF_MEX

3) Read_BDF.cpp: this file is written in C++

These files are part of a large GUI that I am using to analyze EEG and MEG data.

I hope it is of some help to someone.
